# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview
In order to assess the viability of an ice cream and surf shop in Oahu, we analyzed temperature data for the year of 2017. To get a better picture of the year-round viability, we selected two months to generate summary statitistics for: June and December. 

## Results 
* The average temperature was a few degrees higher in June (74.9 degrees F vs. 71.04 degrees F).

June Summary Statistics

December Summary Statistics

* December had a much lower minimum temperature than June (56 degrees F vs. 64 degrees F).

* June had a slightly higher maximum temperature than December (85 degrees F vs. 83 degrees F).

## Summary
While both months were fairly close overall, December seems to have a greater variance in temperature. This is shown by the higher standard deviation and significantly (8 degrees F) lower minimum temperature for December. 
To better assess these results we could use a measurement of how many observations were made in either month. With that metric we could know if any of the differences are attributable to a higher signal from one month or another. 
Additionally, confidence intervals would lend more credibility to these results as they are from a singular year. This could potentially allow for greater extrapolation of our analysis.
